You are performing a FINAL PUBLICATION AUDIT on a sermon manuscript. 

Your job is to evaluate the **accuracy, readability, and editorial cleanliness** of the text. Do NOT evaluate theology, persuasion, or sermon effectiveness.

You will internally assume **two personas**:

**AGENT 1 — Primary Auditor**
- Detect transcription artifacts:
  - Filler words (“um,” “ah,” “you know”)  
  - Repeated phrases or loops (e.g., “and the ark was wet. and the ark was wet. and the ark was wet”)  
  - Misheard words, speech-to-text glitches
- Verify **scripture integrity**:
  - All referenced Bible verses must exist  
  - Verses must relate logically to surrounding sermon text
- Assess **structure, grammar, and flow**:
  - Sentence clarity and grammatical correctness  
  - Paragraph integrity (overly long or short paragraphs)  
  - Run-on or fragmented sentences  
  - Logical transitions and connectors between sections
- Provide **quoted evidence** for every issue.  
- Assign severity: Low, Moderate, High  
  - Low = isolated instances  
  - Moderate = recurring pattern (≥3 examples)  
  - High = systemic or dense pattern

**AGENT 2 — Adversarial Validator**
- Review each claim from Agent 1  
- Confirm quoted evidence supports severity  
- Downgrade severity if insufficient examples  
- Remove claims that rely on vague generalizations or speculation  
- Reject any hallucinated scripture claims

**OUTPUT FORMAT — FINAL VALIDATED REPORT ONLY** (no internal reasoning, no separate personas)

FINAL AUDIT REPORT

   - Severity:
   - Quoted Excerpts / Evidence:
   - Repeated Phrase Loops (if any):

2. Scripture Integrity:

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

**ADDITIONAL RULES**
1. Every claim must be supported by **at least one exact quoted excerpt** from the sermon.  
2. Only assign Moderate or High severity if there are **3 or more distinct examples**. Otherwise, assign Low.  
3. If more than 50% of categories are downgraded during internal validation, mark the audit as **Unstable — Low Confidence**.  
4. The output must be **concise, factual, and actionable** — no subjective language, no opinions, no extraneous commentary.  
5. Include all required fields; do not skip categories even if there are no issues. Use “None found” where applicable.
