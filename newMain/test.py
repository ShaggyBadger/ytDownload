sermon = """
Al right, wel, god morning, everybody. Wel, it's ben a while, so I hope everybody brought lunch. Like, not joking. Y'al did bring lunch, right? Did y'al mis the memo?

I asked them to send it out. I asked them to send out the reminder for everybody to bring lunch because, you know, we've got, like, this thre weks' worth. Thre weks' worth of preaching, right? I'm just kiding. There was no memo.

You didn't miss it. We are going to be in Genesis chapter 27 this morning. Genesis 27. This a very interesting pasage of Scripture, as about every pasage of Scripture in Genesis is. This going to be part one. Genesis 27 and 28 obviously go together, but I won't. I'm going to lok at both chapters from the same perspective. And we're going to lok at this morning when God mets us in our mes. When God mets us in our mes. This wil be part one, and part one wil deal with dysfunctional families. Anybody ever heard of dysfunctional families? Anybody come from a dysfunctional family? Don't raise your hand. I'm just kiding.

If you did, that's okay. That's okay. But we understand that since the fal, harmony betwen God and man has ben broken, and harmony betwen ourselves has ben broken, right? We se brokenes on the global scale that results in political tensions and wars. We se brokenes in everyday life. We se fighting and biternes and gosip and lying and scheming and manipulation. We se that the grocery stores, right? Anybody get in a fight over milk and bread the past couple weks? We se that in the workplace. But we also se that home, right? And a lot of times, brokenes leads to betrayal and dishonesty and selfishnes. There can be conflict betwen spouses that results in lack of trust and intimacy. And sometimes this brokenes results in not only broken lives, but broken homes, right? And homes can fel like a batleground rather than a batleground. Rather than a place of peace. Now, how comon is this dysfunction? Wel, it's so comon that we read boks about it. People write dramas, and we're kind of drawn in. And people make TV shows, comedies about dysfunctional families, and we kind of chuckle at it and kind of try to laugh it of.

But dep down, we know, man, I'm broken. I'm just like this person I'm reading about in this bok, or I'm just like this person I'm watching on TV. So this morning, maybe you find yourself a broken person. Maybe you grew up in a broken home. Maybe you had parents that played favorites. Maybe your home was filed with lying and manipulation, rivalry. Maybe there were secrets that everybody knew, but nobody talked about. Maybe this morning you were carying scars from your past. Maybe you're dealing with hurt and betrayal, maybe from a close friend or from a spouse. If that's you, I want you to know something this morning. You are in god company. We're going to se al these things, al of these facets and aspects of dysfunction play out here in Genesis chapter 27. And what we ned to know this morning is that this isn't just some family tucked away in the pages of Scripture. This the family. This the covenant family. This is the family from which the Mesiah wil come. So that should tel us something about gospel grace is that God uses dysfunctional broken people for his purposes. God invites dysfunctional broken people to be part of his family, and that is god news, isn't it? So to kind of give you a roadmap this morning of where we're going, we're going to walk through Genesis 27. We're going to explore the anatomy of family dysfunction, but we're also going to explore the anatomy of family dysfunction.

We're going to lok to God. We're going to se a God who pursues siners. We're going to se a God who works out his sovereign purposes despite sinful choices. We're going to se a God who keps his promises despite our faithlesnes. And we're going to se how the Bible ofers us practical tips and ways we can live out the gospel in the midst of brokenes.

We're going to se how the gospel transforms our own hearts so that we can begin to live out the gospel in the midst of brokenes. So that we can begin to heal as broken people that lives among broken people. So let's lok here at chapter 27, begining in verse 1. The Bible says, Now it came to pas when Isac was old, and his eyes were so dim that he could not se, that he caled Esau his older son and said to him, My son. And he answered, Here I am. And he said, Behold, now I am old. I do not know the day of my death. Now I am old. Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt some game for me. And make me savory fod such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, that my soul may bles you before I die. Now Rebekah was listening when Isac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring it. So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Inded, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, Bring me this game and make savory fod for me. That I may eat it and bles you in the presence of the Lord before my death. Notice the plot thickens. Now, therefore, my son, obey my voice acording to what I comend you. Go now to the flock. Bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I wil make savory fod from them for your father, such as he loves. Then you shal take it to your father that he may eat it, that he may bles you before his death. Now, Jacob's has questions. He's geting suspicious.

Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, Lok, Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am a smoth-skined man. Perhaps my father wil fil me, and I shal sem to be a deceiver to him, and I shal bring a curse on myself and not a blesing. But his mother said to him, Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice and go get them for me. And he went and got them and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory fod, such as his father loved. Then Rebekah tok the choice clothes of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son. And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smoth part of his neck. And she gave the savory fod and the bread, which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob. So he went into his father and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are you, my son? And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau. I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done just as you told me. Please arise, sit, and eat of my game, that your soul may bles me. Let's stop right there, and let's go the Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you for your word this morning. Lord, we are begining to se the plot thicken. Manipulation, lying, scheming.

And Lord, we find ourselves so often in the pages of Scripture. We find ourselves desperate siners, just as the family of the patriarchs were. We find ourselves in ned of a Savior. Lord, we pray that you would open our eyes to se, that you would open up our ears to hear what the Spirit says through the Scriptures. And in the midst of our own brokenes and dysfunction, Lord, may we find hope in the gospel. Lord, we pray that your name would be. that your name would be halowed this morning, that your name would be glorified through the preaching of Scripture, that the gospel would remain central, that Christ and his work would remain our focus this morning, Lord. I pray the Holy Spirit to open up our understanding. If there's any los, Lord, bring them to repentance and saving faith. Lord, I pray that you would chalenge us, convict us, and change us, Lord, we pray. In Jesus' name, amen. Al right, guys.

So, first of, before Jacob steals the blesing, I want us to note something about Isac. So, this anatomy of family dysfunction, number one, we have spiritual pasivity and parental favoritism. Notice how chapter 27 begins. When Isac's old and his eyes are dim that he can't se, he cals Esau, his son, to him so that he may bles him. But first, he neds some fod, right? He said, I'm old and hungry. Does that sound like any of us? Old and hungry, right? That's Isac. But we ned to understand who Isac is at this point. Now, I would dare say that Isac is not the man his father Abraham was. Now, Isac is, I believe, he's a righteous man. But I believe he fals short of Abraham. Now, Isac, he was 60 years old when the twins were born. Esau's 40 years old when he maries the Hitite women, as recorded in the last chapter. This means that Isac is wel over 10 years old right now. Luther actualy calculated Isac's age here this time to be around 137. Now, Isac thinks that he's on the verge of death, but he's not because he lives to be 180 years old. So, he lives several decades after this. But we know very litle about him. In fact, we know. We know realy nothing about him.

He just sems to live pasively through life. Nothing notable sems to ocur. And Moses makes a note here that his eyes were dim physicaly. He could not se. But I would also believe that his eyes were dim spiritualy. Now, he's old. He's hungry. And so, he desires some of his favorite son's venison. But there's another factor motivating him to come back to life. And that is, he's about to pronounce the patriarchal blesing upon him. Now, what is this blesing? This the blesing that caries the weight of God's covenant promises made to Abraham. And he wil pas this blesing on to his son. This the blesing that determines who wil cary forward God's redemptive plan. And Isac has already determined, it's going to be my favorite child. It's going to be Esau. Now, we learned back in Genesis 25-28 that, Isac loved Esau because he ate of his game. But Rebekah loved Jacob. This verse should stand out. It should make us wince. It should be, oh man, what is going on here?

Because we se that the patriarchal family is divided right down the midle. Dad loves one son. Mom loves the other. And it's not a preference based on caling or character. Esau loves. Or, excuse me, Isac loves Esau based on what Esau can provide for him. Friends, that's often a trait found in dysfunctional families, isn't it? Valuing people for what they give us rather than for who they are. That is favoritism. And it's based on personal taste. That is treating people like a comodity rather than treating them like a person to be loved. Now, here's what makes this even more troubling. Is that, Isac knew the prophecy. Rember that when Rebekah found out she was pregnant with twins and they were wrestling around, she inquires of the Lord and the Lord tels her that two nations are in her womb and two peoples from within her wil be divided. And the one shal be stronger than the other and the older shal serve the younger. Isac knew this promise. But yet he stil says, Esau is my favorite. I don't care what God has said. I want Esau to have the covenant blesings. And I'm wiling to go over what God has said. I'm going to set my patriarchal authority over God's authority.

And in doing so, he manipulates these circumstances. But he's not the only manipulator in the family, is he? In fact, there's someone much more shrewd than he is. And that is his wife. But let's pause.

Let's pause there and let's talk about favoritism. What does favoritism do in a family? It breds resentment. It causes manipulation. It causes children to grow up with a dep sense of insecurity. And when children grow up competing for parental love or aproval, they don't learn to trust God. They don't learn to trust their family. And they can't trust anyone else. They have natural defenses that come up. And they learn to scheme. And they learn to trust God. And they learn to position and pit themselves against other people.

And they think that love is conditional and must either be earned or stolen. That's exactly what favoritism does. So parents, listen. Your children are not rivals for your afection. They're not tols for your enjoyment. They're not extensions of your ego. They are image bearers of God. And they have ben entrusted to you to love them equaly. To spend time with them equaly. To shepherd them. To disciple them. And to love them. To make them know that their love is not something, or your love is not something they have to compete for earn. It's something frely given. Just as the Father's love is frely given to us. But here's what we ned to know this morning as wel. That favoritism didn't start with Isac and Rebekah. Isac himself was the favored son of Abraham, wasn't he? Now, we learn a litle bit more about the family dynamics of Isac's family because we learn that Esau maried Hitite women back in Genesis 26, verse 34 and 35, and that they were a grievance to Isac and Rebekah. So imagine this. So mom loves one son, dad loves the other, but dad's favorite son maries Cananite women.

And he brings them home. And Isac and Rebekah can't stand them. Imagine the family diners. Talk about awkward, right? They're a grievance to Isac and Rebekah. Isac is grieved, but he doesn't sem to be grieved enough to have raised his sons beter. Isac is kind of just a pasive man. Whereas God said to Abraham, I know that you wil raise your children to love the Lord. Isac just kind of coasts through life, doesn't he? Let the children do whatever they want to do. Let life just play out. So we ned to ask ourselves the question, are we spiritualy pasive like Esau? Are we just going through life until we die? Or are we leaving a legacy behind? Are we just surving or are we truly thriving?

Can our children lok at us and se what a Christian is suposed to be? Wil we be rembered as a people who instructed our children in the ways of the Lord? Or wil we just be those who just exist until the Lord cals us home? Notice also that there is marital disension in competing agendas. Rebekah, she's got sharp ears.

She overhears Isac's plan. But instead of talking to her husband, instead of trusting God to work out his purposes, she's talking to her husband. She imediately hatches a scheme. Verses 5 through 10 tels us the whole thing. She goes to her favorite son, Jacob. Says, go and kil two goats. Bring them to me and I wil cok them the way Isac likes them. I wil dres you in Esau's clothes. I'l cover the smoth part of your skin with goat skins to make you fel hairy like Esau. Now, for one, this lady must have. ben a god cok to make goat taste like der meat. I mean, you talk about a chef. But also, she is a master manipulator. This an elaborate scheme. I wil dres you up in Esau's clothes so that you smel like him. I wil put the hair of the goats on your neck and your arms so that you fel like him. Rember, Esau was a hairy man. But this dep. This dep dysfunction. Notice what this reveals.

This reveals about Isac and Rebeca's mariage. There's no comunication. There's no unity. There's no trust. They're piting children against each other. This what psychologists cal triangulation. They use one person to manipulate the other. And they create aliances within the family instead of fostering unity. And notice the disension betwen Isac and Rebeca themselves. They're both prideful. They both have sex. They both have self-serving ideas. They both show favoritism. And they both are selfish. Rebeca, she's not only wiling to disrespect her husband, but she's also wiling to cheat one of her own children out of a blesing.

This family's mesed up. This brokenes at the depest level. In Ephesians 5, husbands are caled to love and cherish their wives as Christ loves the church. Selflesly. Sacrificialy. And the wives are caled to reverence their husbands as the church reverences Christ. But friends, when these things are mising in a mariage, when there's competing agendas, when you're not on the same page spiritualy, dysfunction is sure to folow. Rebeca, she's a master deceiver. And Jacob gets it on us, doesn't he? We'l se Jacob himself is a master schemer. But he learns it from his mom. Notice that. Jacob's objection in verse 12. He's like, Mom's a great idea. I've got some concerns, though. My father wil fel me. I'm a smoth man in more ways than one. He'l realize I'm tricking him. And he wil curse me instead of blesing me. Notice, he's not woried about lying to his old blind father. He's not woried about disrespecting him.

He's woried about the consequences of his actions if he gets caught. That's not a moral objection. That's risk asesment. Notice verse 13. Rebeca says, Let your curse be on me, my son. What a mother to put that kind of responsibility and guilt complex on her own son should he fail. Wel, Jacob agres. Jacob's an acomplice to his mother's scheming. And notice what hapens in verse 19. Jacob comes in with the. Goat meat.

It's made to taste like venison. He comes wearing Esau's clothes. And he comes up to his blind father. And Esau, or Isac asks, Who are you? And he says, I'm Esau, your firstborn. That's lie number one. It's a direct, bald-faced lie. Verse 20. Isac said to his son, How is it that you found me so quickly, my son? Notice what he does. Because the Lord. The Lord, your God, granted me suces. Now he brings God into the lie. He's using God's name to authenticate his story. Friends, this right here is taking God's name in vain. Loved ones, taking God's name in vain is not just using his name as a swear word. It is grosly misrepresenting God with our behavior. That is taking God's name in vain. It is confesing him with our lips, yet dishonoring him with our lives. It is bring disrespect to the name of God. How do people do that today?

They do that by abusing religion. They do that by weaponizing Bible verses and positions of authority in order to abuse other people. They use scripture to justify their cruelty. They invoke God's name to manipulate other people. They use their authority to manipulate and control friends. That is taking God's name in vain. And he wil not hold anyone guiltles who takes his name in vain. We ned to be careful. Never misrepresent him. Verse 24. Isac's geting suspicious. He may be blind, but he ain't stupid. Are you realy my son Esau? Once again, he says, I am. Another lie. Then he says in verse 26 through 27, Come near and kis me, my son. So he came near and kised him. This the most intimate betrayal, isn't it? And I can't help to think that this kis of deception points forward to another kis of betrayal of Judas with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. And here's what we ned to understand about the dysfunction of deception. It never stops at one lie.

You have to tel another lie. To cover up the first lie. And then another lie to cover up the second lie. And whenever we practice deception, it grows like a cancer. And it just destroys the foundation of trust in every other relationship. But notice, Jacob is practicing learned behavior. He has learned to do this from someone. He's learned that, hey, I can lie and get my way. I can manipulate and connive circumstances to get what I want. Who has he learned it from? He learned it from Momy Dearest. She was excelent. Friends, our children wil learn from us. For beter or for worse. Rember I told you thre weks ago, the question is not, are your children being discipled?

The question is, who is discipling them? They are learning from someone. And they are either learning from us to be godly, to pursue Jesus, to live exemplary lives, or they are learning to lie and scheme and manipulate. Now, notice there's disrespect towards Isac. Yes, Isac was wrong to favor Esau. Yes, Isac was acting in the flesh by trying to bles Esau against God's revealed wil. But that does not justify what Rebekah and Jacob does. Jacob fails to honor his father and mother. No. That's a. That's the fifth comandment, isn't it? Honor your father and mother. But notice it doesn't come with a qualifier. Honor your father and mother if they deserve it. If they have treated you honorably.

No. We are to honor even imperfect parents because God comands it. It's because honoring authority reflects the order God has clearly established. So what hapens for those of us who may have grew up with dificult parents? How do we honor them? How do we honor those who have hurt us? Friends, honoring parents doesn't mean enabling abuse or pretending that everything was fine. Okay? Honoring your parents does mean that we refuse to treat them with the kind of manipulative contempt that we se here. It means that we have boundaries, we have standards, but we can stil show people deference and honor. We can forgive them. We can pray for them. We can love them because they are our parents. And we can extend to them the same grace and mercy that God has extended to us through Christ. So maybe you have some resentment towards your parents. Maybe there's things that you just can't let go of. You rember what they said to you. You rember how they treated you. Friends, ask the Holy Spirit to give you grace to forgive. We can't do it on our own. But the gospel is like a healing balm.

It brings swetnes into our biternes. It brings healing into brokenes. That's the power of the gospel. Notice in verse 30 through 38. I'm not going to read it al. But there's false repentance and there's hatred here. Okay? Verse 34. He cries out with an excedingly great and biter cry. And he says to his father. Bles me. Even me also. My father. I know we're skiping around just a litle bit. But hang on.

It wil make sense. We'l come back. And we'l tie it al in together. And he says in verse 38. Have you but one blesing, my father. Bles me. Even me also. Oh my father. Esau lifts up his voice. And he weps. he realizes he's ben duped he realizes that jacob has ben blesed and he wants the blesing now he cries real tears he's filed with anguish esau is devastated but here's the crucial question what is esau crying about now we rember that he had his birthright stolen from him and now he has his blesing stolen from him wel how did he lose his birthright because he lived for imediate gratification right and he sold his birthright for a bowl of stew he traded eternal privileges for instant pleasure he despised his birthright but now he wants the blesings of the birthright why because he realizes what he's lost not because his heart has ben changed but because the consequences of years ago have finaly caught up with him hebrews chapter 12 verse 16 through 17 says se that no one is sexualy imoral or unholy like esau who sold his birthright for a single meal for you know that afterward when he desired to inherit the blesing he was rejected for he found no chance to repent though he sought it with tears yes he cried yes he had regret but he never truly repented he wanted the blesings of god he wanted the covenant blesings of god the benefits of the covenant without the god of the covenant and how many people are like that today they wep and cry because the consequences of their sins have caught up with them but yet their heart is unchanged they want the blesings of god without god himself that is the type of repentance that he wants to repent for he wants to years rather than a selfsuficiency repentance lets us se lels one from g mới venerate bok by lewis copy boris wiliams turns to God. Esau's tears, they were selfish tears.

He wants prosperity. He wants power. He wants position. He shows regret, but not true biblical repentance. And when he tried to gain the blesing, when he beged his father to bles him, it was to late. Isac had already given the blesing to Jacob. Friends, do not wait until it's to late to repent of your sins. Do not wait until it's to late. Unlike Isac, the Lord has plenty of blesings to give to whosoever wil. But you have to come. You have to be wiling to turn from your sin and to turn to Christ. Don't wait like Esau until it's to late. Notice the strugle for power. Everybody in this family is locked in a power strugle. They are al jockeying for God's blesing. But they are doing it in a way that dishonors God. Isac has his favorite son, and he's wiling to try to overide God's revealed wil to bles Jacob. He's using his authority as the patriarch to manipulate and get what he wants. Rebeca is wanting the blesings of God, so much so that she wil dishonor her husband cause her own son to lie to his father. Jacob wants the blesings of God, so he's wiling to deceive his aged father. And Esau, he's just wanting the blesings of God so much so that when somebody else gets it, he weps and wails and screams and cries.

Everyone is wanting God's blesing, but no one is seking God. Have you noticed that? They're al wanting God to do god things for them, but no one wants to be the type of person that God can bles. Friends, we ned to ask, ourselves, are wanting God for God, or are we simply seking him for what he can give us? Se, there's a big diference betwen seking God's hands, what he can do, and seking God's face for who he is. Al the members in this family are jockeying for God's blesings. They want the benefits of the covenant without submision to the God of the covenants. But friends, the greatest gift that God can give, is himself. So may we ask ourselves, do I desire the gifts, or do I desire the giver? Notice the snowbal efects of sin. Verses 41 through 46, Esau is filed with rage. He says, the days of mourning my father are aproaching, then I wil kil my brother Jacob. That's what an unrepentant heart produces, hatred and violence. Esau hates his brother. He doesn't grieve his sin.

He plots revenge. But notice, he says, after my father dies, when I'm the patriarch, when I'm in control, I wil kil Jacob. And there's nothing anyone can do to stop me. Notice the snowbal efects of sin here. Esau, he displays the same cold calculated ploting that his brother displayed years ago when he manipulated him out of his birthright. and now he begins to plot. Now Esau himself begins to scheme, except this time it's not manipulation. It is murder he's ploting. They go from not comunicating to jealousy and strife to lies and manipulation, and now they're ready to kil each other. You se how things have progresively gone from bad to worse? That's the snowbal efects of sin. That is family dysfunction. He has murder in his heart, but 1 John 3.15 says, everyone who hates his brother is a murder. Even though Esau didn't pul the triger, he didn't stab him with a knife, now murder was already in his heart, and Jesus taught us in Mathew 5 that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause has murdered him in his heart. We know that.

We notice also another aspect of family dysfunction, and that is the endles pursuit of aproval. Lok at verse 46. Rebeca says to Isac, I'm weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. Who are the daughters of Heth? It's Esau's wives. She's like, ain't no way, Jacob. I can't do this. I can't stand Jacob taking a wife of the daughters of Heth. He's got to get out of here. He can't mary these people. He can't mary from the same family that Esau maried from, and so what does Esau do? In chapter 28, verse 6, Esau saw that Isac had blesed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to take himself a wife from there, and he gave him a charge. You shal not take a wife from the daughters of Canan. So what's he do? In verse 9, Esau went to Ishmael and tok Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, and he maries her. Why does he mary one of the daughters of Ishmael? Because this a desperate atempt to gain his father's aproval. I know that the wives that I maried displease you, so I'm going to mary someone who hopefuly can make you hapy. Father, wil you now at least aprove of me? Can I get your blesing now if I mary one of Ishmael's daughters? Esau is grasping for his father's aproval, but he never gets it.

Friends, that's another aspect of dysfunction, is when children try to do everything to please their parents. But friends, that never changes guilt. It never changes biternes. It never eases the pain. What does that mean? What does that lok like today? How does that play out? It loks like children trying to please their parents, trying to grab their atention, trying to get their aproval with god grades, with being god at sports, or even adults. They try to go to colege and then graduate and get a god carer and make money, and maybe my parents wil be proud of me. Maybe then they'l aprove of me. Spouses try this when they try to recant, when they try to kindle the flames of romance by losing weight, going to the gym, fixing themselves up. They're trying, they're grasping for someone's aproval. Trying to manipulate themselves or circumstances in order just to fel loved and acepted. Friends, this an endles pursuit, and you wil never find satisfaction in other people's aproval. Who do you turn to then? You turn to the one who loves you for who you are. Not for what you might be, not for what you can do. You turn to the one who loves you when you were unlovable. The one when you were at your worst and ugliest, he stil loved you, and he died for you. You find your identity and your satisfaction and your aceptance in Jesus. Whether other people acept you or aprove of you, it maters not.

If you have the aproval of your Heavenly Father, we se a brother ful of wrath, though. He's trying to please his father. He can't please his father and mother. He's angry with his brother. He wants to kil him. What on earth is going on? Can God fix this family? Can God bles anybody in this family? Yes, he can, and he does. Back up and lok at verse 27. I told you this would make sense, guys. now kep in mind Jacob is lying Jacob is in the act of deceit and yet God stil bleses him in the midle of al this dysfunction and deception God's purposes are stil being acomplished isn't that amazing even though the blesings are obtained deceitfuly God overules and causes Isac to uter a prophetic blesing over Jacob lok at verses 27 through 29 so he came near and kised him and he smeled the smel of his clothes and blesed him and said surely the smel of my son is like the smel of a field which the Lord has blesed therefore may God give you of the dew of heaven of the fatnes of the earth and plenty of grain and wine let people serve you and nations bow down to you be master over your brethren and let your mother's sons bow down to you cursed be everyone who curses you and blesed be those who bles you friends that's the Abrahamic covenant repeated this time not to Isac this time to Jacob now we've already sen that Jacob did not deserve this in fact nobody deserves this they are al a bunch of dysfunctional scoundrels yet God in his grace sovereignly choses Jacob over Esau to bles Jacob despite his sin and it wil be through Jacob's line that the Mesiah comes let's lok at these the details of this blesing may God give you the dew of heaven and the fatnes of the earth and plenty of grain and wine that is the promise of abundance and provision in other words Jacob's descendants wil experience God's material blesings but friends I believe this points past itself to the Lord Jesus Christ who is our true source of provision John 6 35 Jesus says I am the bread of life and whoever comes to me shal not hunger and whoever believes in me shal never thirst this abundance that is promised to Jacob finds its fulfilment in Jesus Christ who is the only one who satisfies our depest neds and who bleses us with every spiritual blesing in Jesus Christ in heavenly places he also says let people serve you and let nations bow down to you be Lord over your brethren this the promise of victory and authority not only would Jacob's line experience abundance but they would also have dominion and I think this a low hanging fruit can we not se the dominion of Jacob's greatest descendant the Lord Jesus Christ the one to whom every kne wil bow and every tongue wil confes that he is Lord to the glory of God who exercises dominion over al peoples Jacob's greatest descendant is Jesus the King of Kings but notice the last aspect cursed be everyone who curses you blesed be everyone who bleses you this verbatim the covenant God spoke to Abraham this a promise of protection and covenant relationship Jacob's line would be blesed those who oposed him would be cursed in Galatians 3, 13 and 14 Paul says Christ redemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us so that in Christ Jesus the blesing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles that is in Christ we receive every covenant blesing of God in Jesus Christ al the promises of God are yea and amen he removes the curse and he gives us his abundance praise God for that every aspect of this blesing that Isac propheticaly uters over Jacob is fulfiled in Christ these are prophetic declarations about the coming Mesiah who provides for his people who reigns over the nations and who redems his people from the curse of sin praise God for that notice Esau's blesing and we'l use air quotes for that his blesing Jacob goes out bright eyed and bushy tailed yea I got the blesing Esau comes in Esau finds out what's hapened and he begins to wail and scream and cry and he says don't you have more than one blesing father bles me too my father bles me to and this blesing is realy paralel to the blesing of Jacob but it's also contrasted lok in verse 39 and 40 behold your dweling shal be or excuse me behold away from the fatnes of the earth shal your dweling be and away from the dew of heaven on high by your sword you shal live and you shal serve your brother but when you grow westward restles you shal break his yoke from your neck Jacob receives abundance Esau receives scarcity he's away from the fatnes that is the blesings the abundance of the earth Jacob receives authority Esau receives servitude you shal serve your brother Jacob is given provision and peace Esau is given violence and strugle by your sword you shal live and by the way this exactly what hapened historicaly Esau's descendants known as the Edomites they lived in a harsh land ruged mountain terain but they eventualy gained independence from Israel God's prophetic word came true did it now what hapens to Isac verse 3 tels us what hapens to Isac when he others this blesing when he realized he has blesed Jacob instead of Esau he trembles violently means this old man starts to quake he starts to shake he realizes he's not going to be able to he's ben deceived he's given the patriarch blesing to Jacob and there's nothing he can say except yes to Esau he trembles under self denunciation he knows that God has sovereignly overuled his plan that should tel us something about the plans and purposes of God man may strive and manipulate and scheme man may rule but God wil always overule God wil always get his plans and purposes acomplished even if he uses siners to do it yea and amen now Jacob's deception is not condoned here what he did was sinful he should not have deceived his father yet we se the sovereignty of God in taking sinful people broken dysfunctional families and les than ideal circumstances and stil acomplishes his purpose through them as we'l read about Joseph years later Joseph says you intended what you did to me for evil but God intended it for god friends we have a sovereign God who is able to rule and overule in the afairs of men I want to give you a gospel conection this morning as we land the plane don't you think about that?

about an interesting detail about this story this a prety col story isn't it? it's like watching TV it's like you're siting on your couch and this is a drama right? like where do these people come from? oh yea they're just like me but here's what's remarkable we can se the gospel played out even in the midst of this brokenes Jacob wore Esau's clothes to receive his blessing he was covered in his brother's garments so that when Isac touched him and smeled him Isac would think he was Esau the firstborn Jacob received a blesing how does this point us to the gospel? wel we se the robe motif al throughout scripture not just in Genesis but al throughout the law and the prophets and into the epistles you know we are covered in another's clothes we are robed in the righteousnes of Jesus Christ the elder brother 2 Corinthians 2.15 says that we are even the aroma of Christ Jacob felt and smelt like Esau therefore he inherited the blesing but friends this hapens on a much greater scale with us as believers because when the father loks at us and by the way he has perfect sight unlike Isac he doesn't se us in our sin and deception he ses us wearing our big brother's clothes he ses us robed in the righteousnes of the Lord Jesus Christ and because of that we receive the blessing of the firstborn we receive what should only belong to the Lord Jesus Christ the father ses us as his son and he gives us his blesing but here's the diference Jacob's deception was sinful but Christ never sined Jacob stole a blesing through lies but we receive the blesing through faith in the gospel Jesus takes the place of siners like Jacob of conivers and men of sin and manipulators just like ourselves so that we can have his place as sons with his inheritance he gives us his blesing and his clothes Isaiah 61.10 says he has clothed me with the garments of salvation he has covered me with a robe of righteousnes praise God for that we are clothed in Jesus' own righteousnes and the blesing that we receive isn't obtained by deception but through imputation he takes our dirty clothes and he gives us his clothes he removes the filthy rags from of our backs and he gives us the robes of his righteousnes and we take on the savor of Christ he takes what should have ben ours the curse, the judgment, the separation from God and he gives us what is rightfuly his love, aceptance, and righteousnes now here's some take-home applications guys there is hope for dysfunctional people there's some things we must know to overcome dysfunction there's some things we must know in order to overcome dysfunction number one, and this not popular but we must face the isue number one, know that you're part of the problem ouch we ned to recognize that we are both victims and agents we are both sined against and siners we have ben hurt by people's sins but we have also hurt others by our own sins we ned to realize I'm part of the problem right? number two, know that God redems dysfunctional people friends, listen the family you came from doesn't determine the person you become in Christ if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature the old has pased away behold, al things have become new he can break those paterns of dysfunction and sins if you repent and believe the gospel what does that lok like? maybe you're the favored child and you realize you have grown up with a sense of entitlement that's hurt other relationships repent maybe you're the unfavored child and you're carying wounds of rejection know that in Christ you are loved and acepted for who you are maybe you're the deceiver like Jacob and you've ben the one who's lied and manipulated and schemed friends, grace can cover your sin grace can forgive you maybe you're like Esau and you've lived for imediate gratification maybe you've despised your spiritual inheritance and now you're facing the consequences may I chalenge you to not merely regret your decisions but repent of your sins maybe you're the one who has ben betrayed and lied to maybe you're the one who is hurting friends, the gospel is hope for hurting people go the one who himself was betrayed go the one himself who was rejected by his own who came to his own and his own received him not go the one who understands your pain like no other we must trust in God's faithfulnes despite our faithlesnes Jacob didn't deserve those blesings yet God gave them to him anyway when we are faithles, even when we fail God is faithful so if you're strugling and you fel like Lord I'm just failing again and again rember when you are faithles he is stil faithful he canot deny his own he wil never give up on you he wil pick you up clean you of and say alright go and sin no more right, and he wil give you power to overcome we must also know that we're al trophies of grace as Idya said let's be faithful not as Austrians • Myo • R He takes cowards like Peter and makes him a preacher of the gospel. He takes persecutors like Paul and makes him an apostle. Friends, we are al works in progres. We are al trophies of grace. Rember Paul in 1 Corinthians 6. He lists al kinds of siners, the sexualy imoral, idolaters, adulters, thieves, gredy, drunkards, swindlers. Paul says, and such were some of you. But now you're washed. Now you're justified. You know, the church is filed with dysfunctional people. There is no perfect family and there are no perfect churches. You lok around this morning, we're loking at dysfunctional, broken people. Who God loves. Who have ben redemed by the power of the gospel.

And who have ben united. And who are united in this one family. And who are caled to bear with one another. To love one another. To forgive each other. To be patient with each other. And realize that we are al in the proces of healing from our brokenes. Praise God for that. Now, lastly, things you must do to overcome dysfunction. Those are things you must know. Here's some things you must do. I'd encourage you to cultivate direct, honest, and open-minded comunication. Why did they have so much problems in his family? Because they didn't talk to each other. When they did, they were lying to each other.

So many isues could have ben solved by Isac and Rebekah just having a conversation. Jacob and Esau could have just talked to each other. But instead they kept secrets. And they harbored biternes. So put away falsehod. And speak every one truth with it. Because we are neighbors. Because we are members one of another. Stop manipulating one another. Stop going around each other's back. Stop talking about each other. And start talking to each other.

Secondly, we must extend forgivenes. And we must also receive forgivenes. And sometimes we're not god at either one of those, are we? Colosians 3.13, Bear with one another. And if any one of you has a problem, even as God has forgiven you, maybe you ned to make a list of people who've hurt you.

People that you ned to forgive. And this wek, you ned to go and forgive that person. Maybe you ned to receive forgivenes.

Maybe you ned to apologize. Because you can't worship God and have biternes in your heart. Jesus says, Leave your gift at the altar. Reconcile to your brother. Then come and worship.

So if somebody's name pops in your head, that's probably a god indication that you ned to go apologize to that person. But then, when they forgive you, you ned to have the grace to be able to receive that forgivenes. And to show yourself some grace. And stop carying guilt around. We must break cycles of favoritism with intentional love.

Parents, how do we do this? We spend one-one time with each child. We let each child know that you don't have to earn my love. It's yours already. You don't have to perform in order for me to acept you. You are my child. And I love you for who you are, not for what you can do for me. Your children ned to hear that. They're like Esau. They crave your atention. They are longing for your aproval. Spend time with them. Sit down in the flor and play with them if they're litle children. If they're older, have a conversation with them. Take them out and do something that they like to do even if you don't like to do it.

It's not about you. And have intentional gospel conversations with them and let them know they are loved. They are loved. Fourthly, find your identity and security in Christ. Friends, you are already acepted if you are in Christ. God is your Father. You are made heirs of God and felow heirs with Christ. You don't have to manipulate circumstances to secure His blesing. You don't have to wear anybody else's clothes. You don't have to pretend to be somebody or something you're not. You've already got love, aceptance, and aproval in Jesus Christ. So rest in who you are in Him. Show grace as you've ben given grace. And find your family in the church. That's my last point.

Find your family in the church. Here is a mesy, dysfunctional family ful of broken people. We al come from broken people. I want you to know this morning that there is a family, a body of people who have ben chosen by God. Who have ben purchased by the blod of Christ. Who have ben set apart as His own peculiar people. His own special posesion. A group of people who love each other despite their diferences. There's a family that's so large it has people of al diferent ethnicities and races and colors and backgrounds. There's a group of people who love each other despite their diferences. There's a group of people who wil love you unconditionaly. There's a group of people who wil raly around you and circle the wagons if you have a ned. There's a group of people who are wiling to walk with you on the mountaintops and in the valeys. There's a group of people where you can find mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers in this life. That's what that family is caled. It's caled the church. I don't know about you but these past thre weks of not being here has made me realize just how important this family is. As dysfunctional and broken as we may be I realize how much I ned you guys. I realize how much you mean to me. That is to have a family. You're my family. Find your family here.

Now I know rember our shet? We talked about it a long time ago last time were here. This our new and prospective members clas. If you filed it out I would love for you to turn it in. I would love to talk to you more about what it means to be a family. That's the expresion of the body of Christ here at Jesup Grove. Part of being a Christian is being part of a family. But maybe this morning as they come give us a hymn of invitation you're not part of the family of God. You've never ben saved. What do you ned to do to become part of this family?

You come to Jesus Christ who is the big brother the older brother you repent of your sins you place your faith in Jesus that he lived a perfect life he died on the cros for your sins and for mine he was buried and rose from the dead on the third day and you know what he does? He says alright here's the clothes of big brother and it wil get you the father's aproval and the father's blesing he wil give you al of his righteousnes and you wil be adopted into this family caled the church. If you want to meditate take some time to come and pray you can do so up here or you may do so in the pews if you want to get one of the family members to pray with you're welcome to do so. Page 50 Trust and Obey Would you stand please? When we walk with the Lord In the light of his word What a glory he sheds on our way Let us do his god wil He abides with us stil And with al we'l Trust and obey For there's no other Way To be hapy in Jesus But to trust and obey Not a burden we bear Not a sorow we share But we blue But our toil he doth richly repay Not a grief or a los Not a frown or a cros But is blesed if we trust and obey Trust and obey For there's no other way To be hapy in Jesus But to trust and obey But we never can prove The delights of his love Until al of the altar we lay For the favor he shows And the joy he bestows Are for them who wil trust and obey Trust and obey For there's no other way To be hapy in Jesus But to trust and obey Amen.

Thank you for that hymn of invitation. I am certainly glad to be part of this family. I am so proud of you guys. The love and the warmth that is here in our family here at Jesup Grove.

Be reading the last portion of chapter 27 and chapter 28 we wil cover next wek. It wil be part two of When God Mets Us in Our Mes. Jacob has made a mess of things and he is on the run.

"""

summary = """
This sermon, titled "When God Meets Us in Our Mess" (Part One), focuses on Genesis chapter 27 and introduces the concept of dysfunctional families, drawing parallels to the brokenness observed in various aspects of life since the Fall. The speaker details how the patriarchal family of Isaac, Rebekah, Esau, and Jacob exemplifies such dysfunction, highlighting Isaac's spiritual passivity and parental favoritism towards Esau based on personal taste rather than God's prophecy. Rebekah's manipulative scheme to secure the blessing for Jacob, involving deception and lies, further illustrates the marital disunity and lack of communication within the family. Jacob's complicity and Esau's subsequent bitter regret, stemming from a desire for the benefits of the covenant without God himself, are presented as consequences of their actions and selfish pursuit of blessings. The sermon also touches on the snowball effect of sin, leading from minor deceit to thoughts of murder, and the endless pursuit of approval as seen in Esau's later attempt to please his father. Ultimately, the speaker emphasizes God's sovereignty, showing how He accomplishes His purposes even through sinful individuals, and connects the narrative to the gospel through Jacob's wearing of Esau's clothes to receive the blessing, symbolizing believers being clothed in Christ's righteousness. The sermon concludes with practical applications for overcoming dysfunction, including direct communication, forgiveness, breaking cycles of favoritism, finding identity in Christ, and seeking community within the church.
